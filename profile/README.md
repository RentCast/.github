# Welcome to the RentCast API GitHub Page ðŸ‘‹

Our real estate and property data API provides access to 140+ million property records, owner details, home value and rent estimates, comparable properties, active sale and rental listings, as well as aggregate real estate market data.

We provide nationwide coverage for most residential and commercial properties in the United States, as well as rental market data coverage for most US zip codes and cities.

You can use our API and property data to power and enrich your real estate applications, SAAS projects, CRM systems, internal operations, or business workflows.
